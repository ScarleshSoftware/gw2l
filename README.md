# gw2l-react

## SETUP

----
- Download Node.js from: https://nodejs.org/en/
- On windows, set the execution policy from PS as an Administrator and run:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy AllSigned -Scope LocalMachine
```
- For VSCode: `Ctrl + P` and write ``ext install npm script runner`` otherwise it won't be able to use npm in its integrated terminal
- Install expo globally `npm install --global expo-cli`


## Dev

```sh
npm start
```

In case, like I do, forget to update `expo` (curently v.47.0.0):
```sh
expo update
```
